# Grip-Classification
## Project Overview
When performing different types of hand grips, different forearm muscles are activated at different intensities. The objective of this project was to develop a portable device that can classify and predict hand grip types in real time using surface electromyography signals (sEMG) on the flexor digitorum profundus. Through the data collection of 6 hand grip types (spherical, palmer, tip, hook, lateral, and cylindrical), a machine learning model was trained to accurately classify the particular hand grip being performed. The setup includes a single bipolar EMG sensor to collect the electrical signals of the muscle contractions. The model was implemented on a LilyGo ESP32 T-Display, making a compact and wearable, real-time, machine learning-powered EMG device.
