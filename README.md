## Project Overview
When performing different types of hand grips, different forearm muscles are activated at different intensities. The objective of this project was to develop a portable device that can classify and predict types of hand grips in real time using surface electromyography signals (sEMG) on the flexor digitorum profundus. After collecing data on the muscle activity during 6 hand grip types (spherical, palmer, tip, hook, lateral, and cylindrical), a machine learning model was trained to accurately classify the particular hand grip being performed. This project utilizes a single bipolar EMG sensor and an ESP32 to collect the electrical signals of the muscle contractions. The model was implemented on a LilyGo ESP32 T-Display, making a compact and wearable, real-time, machine learning-powered EMG device.
